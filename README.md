# Modern Chess

Imagine a variant of chess where the board isn't just a square board. Imagine it was instead filled with obstacles, both immovable and interactable. Imagine it had bridges, different terrain, and occasional stage events. Imagine if your chess pieces had special abilities unique to its rank and that you could use items you pick up off the board to come up with unique strategies to checkmate your opponent's team.

This is my reimagination of chess: Modern Chess
